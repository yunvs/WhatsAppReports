## Information <sub><sup> about me and about this project </sub></sup>

#### Hey üëã Thank you for visiting my GitHub project!

My name is Yunus, I am studying Computational Linguistics at the Heinrich Heine University in D√ºsseldorf, Germany üë®‚Äçüíª. This is a project for my *Advanced Natural Langugae Processing* Class.

<div id="about-the-project"/>  

## 

You can use this program to analyse üßê your chats and get a report about the chat. It can derive statistics of both **private chats** üë§üë§ (between two users) and **group chats** üë•üë§üë• (with multiple users).  
üõë None of your data will be saved in any kind, your machine will derive the statistics and discard your data afterwards. No one other than yourself, will see any of your personal information ‚ÑπÔ∏è nor any of your messages. You can check for your self. üòâ

## How to <sub><sup> analyse a WhatsApp chat </sub></sup>  
First you need to export the chat from WhatsApp. Then you can import and process the chat. Finally, you will get the results.

### **1. Export**:
> #### Export the chat from WhatsApp to a .txt or .zip file

To export a WhatsApp chat, go to the **information page** of that chat. You can export the chat, at the bottom of that page. WhatsApp will ask you, if you want to export the file with or without media. **Export without media files!**  

You will get a **.zip file**, which you have to save. After unziping that file, you will get the actual **.txt file**. It contains all messages of all users in that chat. You can use that file for analyzing, but if you want you can also directly upload the .zip file to the program.  

**üö® IMPORTANT NOTE üö®:** The program currently only works, if the chat is **exported from iOS** AND **without media files**. Preferably upload the **original file** (.txt or .zip).

## Technologies <sub><sup> used for this project </sub></sup>  

### Programming Language: 
> #### This hole project is written in Python, but makes use of some Libraries you can find below. I worked with Anaconda, which is a distribution of the Python language for scientific computing.

<br>

**Python** is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is designed to make simple and easy to use, yet powerful and flexible. Python is used by a wide variety of programmers, and is especially popular for scientific computing. 


Verions used:  **Python 3.9.7** | ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Python website](https://www.python.org/)  

<br>

**Anaconda** is a distribution of the Python and R languages for scientific computing. It includes a complete ecosystem of packages for data science, scientific computing, and software development. It is a free and open source software distribution. 


Verions used:  **Anaconda3 Navigator 2.2.0** | ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Anaconda website](http://www.anaconda.com)
